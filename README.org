* Construct PME datasets
The code here is responsible for converting PME 1984-1990 from its raw form -- as distributed by IBGE -- into readable csv files.

The two main types of ingredients are the following:

1. PME datasets, downloaded and treated (see Usage)
2. PME dictionaries in proper format
   - This repo contains dictionaries that reflect my attempt to parse weird PME documentation files
   - there might be mistakes, I strongly suggest users sift through the files to ensure consistency for their use case

** Dependencies
Make sure ~R~ is installed, as well as the following packages:

- data.table
- glue
- optparse

* Usage

1. Download PME 1980 to 1990 from IBGE website:

   [[ftp://ftp.ibge.gov.br/Trabalho_e_Rendimento/Pesquisa_Mensal_de_Emprego/Microdados/1980_2001/PME_1980_a_2001.zip]]
2. Run ~detox~ utility on all files,
   #+begin_src bash
detox -r -v $PME_DOWNLOADED_PATH
   #+end_src
   where ~$PME_DOWNLOADED_PATH~ should be replaced with its actual download path
3. Clone / download this repo anywhere in your pc
4. Give write permission to ~pmeread.r~, navigating to the directory and running ~chmod +x pmeread.r~
5. Run
   #+begin_src bash
./pmeread.r -i $PME_DOWNLOADED_PATH
   #+end_src

   see ~./pmeread.r -h~ for more options
* Tasks

** Document
- [ ] how should datasets be layed out on ~base_data_path~?
- [ ] how should dictionaries be organized?
