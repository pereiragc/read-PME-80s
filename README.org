* Construct PME datasets
The code here is responsible for converting PME 1984-1990 from its raw form -- as distributed by IBGE -- into readable csv files.

The two main types of ingredients are the following:

1. PME datasets, downloaded and treated
   - Please see TBA for instructions on how to download and treat data
2. PME dictionaries in proper format
   - This repo contains dictionaries that reflect my attempt to parse weird PME documentation files
   - there might be mistakes, I strongly suggest users sift through the files to ensure consistency for their use case

** Dependencies
Please install ~R~ and the following packages for the code to run properly:

- data.table
- glue
- yaml

* Tasks

** Document
- [ ] how should datasets be layed out on ~base_data_path~?
- [ ] how should dictionaries be organized?
