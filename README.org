* Construct PME datasets

The code here is responsible for converting the awkward format in which PME is distributed into readable csv files.

The two main types of ingredients are the following:

1. PME datasets, downloaded and treated
   - Please see TBA for instructions on how to download and treat data
2. PME dictionaries in proper format
   - This repo contains dictionaries that reflect my attempt to parse weird PME documentation files
   - there might be mistakes, I strongly suggest users sift through the files to ensure consistency for their use case

* Tasks

** Document
- [ ] how should datasets be layed out on ~base_data_path~?
- [ ] how should dictionaries be organized?
